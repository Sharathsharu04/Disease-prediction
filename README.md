 5-Day Bootcamp on Disease Predictor

Welcome to the repository for our five-day bootcamp on disease prediction. This program was designed to give participants a complete hands-on experience, starting from the basics of machine learning and ending with a working application that predicts diseases. Instead of being just theory, every day was about building something practical and learning by doing.

# Overview

This bootcamp walked learners through the end-to-end process of building an AI-powered disease prediction system. We began with raw data, turned it into insights, built intelligent models, and finally deployed them as usable applications. The idea was to show how data science can move from concept to impact within just a few days.

# Day-wise Journey

# Day 1 – Laying the Foundation

We began by setting up the environment with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other essentials. The dataset was introduced, and participants explored its structure to understand what kind of health and disease-related data we would be dealing with. This first step gave a clear overview of the problem we were about to solve.

# Day 2 – Preparing the Data

On the second day, the spotlight was on making the data usable. Participants cleaned the datasets, fixed missing values, and visualized patterns to spot possible disease indicators. This step highlighted the importance of features and showed how strong preparation can make future models more reliable.

# Day 3 – Building First Models

With clean data in hand, learners built their first machine learning models. They experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, trained them on the dataset, and compared performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and recall were introduced here, teaching participants how to measure success beyond surface-level numbers.

# Day 4 – Exploring Deep Learning

The fourth day took us into deep learning. Neural networks were introduced, and for image datasets, CNNs were trained to recognize diseases visually. Participants also learned about saving trained models and running them later. The workflow started feeling more complete, with real-world usage in sight.

# Day 5 – Creating the Final Application

The final day was about bringing everything together. Participants built a full prediction pipeline that started from raw data and ended with a prediction-ready model. They even deployed their models as simple web apps using Streamlit or Flask, making them interactive and usable. The bootcamp ended with participants documenting their work and showcasing future improvements, such as adding larger datasets or optimizing models for better accuracy.

# Example Workflow

A typical workflow followed during the bootcamp looked like this:
Collect and clean disease-related data
Explore features and visualize patterns
Train baseline ML models and improve them
Move into deep learning for better performance
Deploy the final model as a user-friendly web application

# Future Improvements

While the bootcamp showed how to get a disease prediction system up and running quickly,future improvements can include expanding the dataset, experimenting with more advanced deep learning architectures, and deploying on cloud platforms for scalability.
